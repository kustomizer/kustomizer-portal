# Tasks: Multidomain Access + Shopify Owner Onboarding

- [x] Add configurable Shopify owner install URL in public environment config.
- [x] Add app-owned install endpoint (`/api/shopify/install`) with optional `shop` and fallback redirect behavior.
- [x] Add app-owned OAuth callback endpoint (`/api/shopify/callback`) with state + HMAC validation and token exchange.
- [x] Add privileged finalize endpoint (`shopify_oauth_finalize`) to persist encrypted credentials from OAuth callback.
- [x] Add Shopify privacy compliance endpoint (`POST /api/webhooks`) with HMAC validation for GDPR topics.
- [x] Add owner store sync endpoint to import linked Shopify stores from legacy schema (`shops` / `v_legacy_store_users`) into portal tables.
- [x] Extend owner store sync to attempt credentials import from legacy `shop_credentials` (encrypted or plaintext token fields).
- [x] Update register/portal empty-state UX to route owner onboarding through Shopify instead of manual store creation.
- [x] Remove manual create-store forms from dashboard/store list UI.
- [x] Add connected/disconnected store status in portal store views, with reconnect and refresh actions for disconnected stores.
- [x] Add owner-only connection status edge endpoint to avoid direct client access to `store_shopify_credentials`.
- [x] Implement multidomain resolution in `kustomizer_auth` using legacy domain mappings.
- [x] Implement multidomain resolution in `kustomizer_shopify_metaobject_get` and `kustomizer_shopify_metaobject_upsert`.
- [x] Keep canonical-domain checks for membership and license validation.
- [x] Add uninstall webhook endpoint to revoke `store_shopify_credentials` tokens on Shopify app uninstall.
- [x] Verify team invite/remove flow is unaffected for owner-managed stores.
- [x] Align Shopify credential encryption/decryption flows on canonical key and add optional legacy key migration path.
- [x] Run typecheck/build validations for Angular + Edge function TypeScript.
- [x] Update `openspec/specs/` to document owner onboarding and multidomain endpoint behavior.
